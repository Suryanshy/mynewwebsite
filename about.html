        <p>Hi we are Agrim and Suryansh and we have made our first brand new website.</p>
        <p>We are kids. I (Agrim) am 12 years old and My friend (Suryansh) is 13 years old.</p>
        <p>I (Agrim) study in standard 6th and My friend (Suryansh) study in 7th standard.</p>
        <p>I (Agrim) have written the whole code by myself on my friend's (Suryansh) computer.</p>
        <p>We know that our website is not looking good but we gave our best in the first try.</p>
        <p>We have leart HTML, CSS and JavaScript in only 2 months that is why our website is not looking good.</p>
        <p>Please support us to make us confident to make more beautiful website.</p>
        <p>Now we are working on a brand new website with more content, more styling and more scripting.</p>
